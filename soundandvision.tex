\epigraph{I have heard, that among the Generality of our People, who being not much addicted to Revelation, have much concern'd themselves about Demonstrations, a Generation has risen up, who to solve the Difficulties of Supernatural Systems imagine \emph{a mighty vast Something}, who has no Form but what represents him to them as one \emph{Great Eye}: The Infinite Optick they imagine to be a \emph{Natura Naturans} \ldots the Soul of Man therefore, in the opinion of these Naturallists is \emph{one vast Optick Power} diffus'd through him into all his Parts, but seated principally in his head. \ldots From hence they resolve all Beings to \emph{Eyes}.}{\textsc{Daniel Defoe, 1705, \emph{The Consolidator}}} % optional; make sure to uncomment \usepackage{epigraph}
